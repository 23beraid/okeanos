# okeanos

The game concept file was a place I wrote original ideas. It is not an accurate representation of how the game works.

Okeanos is a game run using a Discord bot. We are currently hosting the bot for your convenience. To check the status of the bot visit https://stats.uptimerobot.com/JWmO2u8wKY or https://okeanos.aidanberard.repl.co. 

The bot uses custom emojis and images and for that reason only works as intended on pc/mac/linux and on its dedicated server which you can join here: https://discord.gg/nrXBn9mrcHand. 

You can also invite the bot to your own server but there won't be any emojis for the game items (instead, you may see 'none' or a similar error).

You are also welcome to host the bot yourself.
