# okeanos

The discord-based adventure game Okeanos enables players to collaborate with each other to explore the world of buying, selling, stealing, and crafting. One of our main inspirations while creating this game was the theme of discovery. As players play the game, they discover new ways to acquire points by adventuring, stealing, and crafting, allowing them to show their unique ingenuity to their teammates and opponents. We decided to use discord as our game engine for multiplayer capability and the opportunity to use it on any device. Using the discord bot allows players to collaborate seamlessly by going on artifact and mineral collecting adventures or enabling them to embark on an adventure by themself. While Okeanos is a collaborative game, it is indeed a race to conquer the leaderboard as well. By joining either the house of bravery, brilliance, or balance, you are committing to yourself and your team to adventure out, accumulate rewards, and achieve points. Good luck adventuring, and have fun!


NOTE: The game concept file was a place I wrote original ideas. It is not an accurate representation of how the game works. Also, we have alot of 

Okeanos is a text based game you can play using Windows PowerShell (just kidding, you play it using Discord). We are currently hosting the Discord bot for your convenience. To check the status of the bot visit https://stats.uptimerobot.com/JWmO2u8wKY or https://okeanos.aidanberard.repl.co. 

You can invite the bot to your own server https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=828340126782193684&scope=bot&permissions=8 or join the official server here https://discord.gg/nrXBn9mrcHand. This game uses custom emojis which you can add to your server by downloading free from https://hawken-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/23beraid_hawken_edu/Es6U9qW4sxNNo_Hna1vA2uYBc-ly3NHwlL3yO4MRGtX5yA?e=9EgFuj. The game will be able to use these emojis regardless of whether they're downloaded or not (hypothetically) but if you want to use them yourself you must download. 

You are welcome to host the bot yourself.

Anyway, once you're ready to play start by typing o-help in a text channel. Remeber to join a house before completing other game actions. When playing the game, the bot might respond to certain commands through DM to prevent clogging up the channel. It also might delete certain command invocations so other users don't know what trickery you're up to. Please don't abuse the bot by spamming, and have fun.

Our repo is kind of a mess, but for your convenience I have included all the stuff you actually need to look at in the okeanos.zip file. The .env file in there is not important don't read it.
