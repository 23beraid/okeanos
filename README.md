Game concept.
Premise: an ancient civilization has been discovered under the sea. Find different items.
The map will be divided into regions accessible by players with various roles. 
Roles:
  Navigator: Can access the Foggy Isles. Although visibility is limited, she can traverse the treacherous straights.
  Cutterman: Can access the Deep Sea. He maintains a steady vessel in the tallest winds and waves. 
  Diver: Can access the Underwater Trench. Pretty self-explanatory.
  Radioman: Can access the Ports. He navigates this heavily-trafficked area by communicating with other vessels.
 
 Players pick a role at the beginning of the game. Then they go exploring and find stuff. They can trade directly with other players to collect all of the stuff.
 Once they do, they get a reward. End of rules.
