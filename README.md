# okeanos

The game concept file was a place I wrote original ideas. It is not an accurate representation of how the game works.

Okeanos is a game run using a Discord bot. We are currently hosting the bot for your convenience. To check the status of the bot visit https://stats.uptimerobot.com/JWmO2u8wKY or https://okeanos.aidanberard.repl.co. 

The bot uses custom emojis and images and for that reason only works as intended on pc/mac/linux and on its dedicated server which you can join here: https://discord.gg/nrXBn9mrcHand. 

You can also invite the bot to your own server but there won't be any emojis for the game items (instead, you may see 'none' or a similar error). 
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=828340126782193684&scope=bot&permissions=8. To fix this you can add the required emojis to your own server by downloading them from https://hawken-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/23beraid_hawken_edu/Es6U9qW4sxNNo_Hna1vA2uYBc-ly3NHwlL3yO4MRGtX5yA?e=9EgFuj.

You are also welcome to host the bot yourself.
