Game concept.
Premise: an ancient civilization has been discovered under the sea. Find different items.
The map will be divided into regions accessible by players with various roles. 
Roles:
  Navigator: Can access the Foggy Isles. Although visibility is limited, she can traverse the treacherous straights.
  Cutterman: Can access the Deep Sea. He maintains a steady vessel in the tallest winds and waves. 
  Diver: Can access the Underwater Trench. Pretty self-explanatory.
  Radioman: Can access the Ports. He navigates this heavily-trafficked area by communicating with other vessels.

forget about the roles we won't use those



 Work together to uncover ancient artifacts, combine them into sets, and sell them to the museum. 
Houses: Players will be divided into THREE houses (based on their discord badges or personal choice). A leaderboard will keep track of which house has the most points.

POINTS will be earned by DONATING items to the museum. CURRENCY will be earned by SELLING sets to the museum. Sets will consist of four items of the same type or element. ITEMS will be obtained from the MARKETPLACE or from ADVENTURES. Once a player has donated every artifact and mineral to the museum, they will receive a reward.
